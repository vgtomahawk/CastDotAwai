This folder is for one shot independent scripts to show proof of concept working of API or some other simplified trick. Current scripts are:

1. call_elevenlabs.py : Authored by Yi-Te , this is a basic snippet calling TTS API of Eleven Labs to generate a code-mixed Hi string vocalized in multiple languages as a continuous segment.
